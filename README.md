# Colorful-Pascal-Triangle
An exploration of Pascal's triangle based on coloring all the distinct numbers of a given modulus.

Use any recent version of Python (tested with Python 3.5).

Change the arguments passed to testGeneratePascal() on the last line of Pascals_0_4.py and run it.

The first argument represents the given modulus (<=10), the second represents how many iterations to draw.

See the uploaded screenshots for example outputs.
